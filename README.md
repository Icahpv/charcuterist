**Problems Encountered:**

1. Images: could not get them to the right size. Could not also put them in a container each.
2. Centering images: Had a hard time finding out how to center and make one image per three columns in desktop.
- Solution: Justify-items: center;
- I've been using justify-content.
3. Heart button: Could not figure out the check box hack. I made it hover to grayscale to make it look clickable and I changed the cursor as well.
4. Footer: I wanted to center my footer but there's a padding that I could not find where it's from, I settled for a different design.
